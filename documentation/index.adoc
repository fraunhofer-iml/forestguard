== Documentation Approach

The documentation of this project is in English and is based on the https://arc42.de/template[arc42 template].

The https://agilemanifesto.org/[Agile Manifesto] says: "Working software over comprehensive documentation".
It does *not* say "no documentation".
Even in lean, agile and iterative development approaches, an appropriate amount of documentation will help numerous stakeholders doing a better job.
arc42 is completely process-agnostic, and especially well-suited for lean and agile development approaches.
It is supposed to be used "on demand" - you provide only the type or amount of information required for your specific documentation purpose.
Documentation shall be part of your Definition-of-Done.
Therefore, arc42 is _automatically_ included in Scrum processes.
