= Architecture Constraints

Various constraints are respected for the design of the {projectName} project.
They all affect the solution.
We list these restrictions and explain their motivations.
Some of these constraints go beyond individual {projectName} modules and are valid for the whole platform or organization.

== Technical Constraints

The following technical constraints apply:

[cols="0,3,6",options="header",]
|===
| *Id*
| *Constraint*
| *Value/Description*

| *BAP1*
| Basic Architecture Patterns
| Microservices

| *BAP2*
| Basic Architecture Patterns
| Every Microservice is executed in an application container

| *BAP3*
| Basic Architecture Patterns
| Loose coupling

| *BAP4*
| Basic Architecture Patterns
| Event-based communication (when appropriate)

| *TE1*
| Target environment
| OKD/Kubernetes (basic stack of a Silicon Economy Platform)

| *BSD1*
| Basic Stack for Development: Application Container
| Docker

| *BSD2*
| Basic Stack for Development: Interfaces/Communication
| HTTP/REST, MQTT, AMQP, WebSockets

| *BSD3*
| Basic Stack for Development: programming languages
| Programming Languages: JavaScript/TypeScript

| *BSD4*
| Basic Stack for Development: blockchain
| Blockchain Development: Solidity

| *BSD5*
| Basic Stack for Development: frontend
| Frontend Development: Angular

| *BSD6*
| Basic Stack for Development: other
| All other technologies must be compatible with OKD/Kubernetes

| *BC1*
| Continuous Integration Pipeline constraints
| Integrated with the GitLab CI Runner

| *BC2*
| Project License
| Developed under the Open Logistics Foundation License 1.3

| *BC3*
| Requirements at libraries
| Only libraries under a Copy-Left free Open Source License can be used. Accepted open source licenses are, among others, *Apache License 2.0, MIT License, BSD License*

| *BC4*
| Libraries constraints
| Frameworks & libraries under an open-source license (such as GPL, LGPL) are restricted by the use of the Open Logistics Foundation License 1.3

== Organizational Constraints

The following organizational constraints apply:

[cols="0,3,6",options="header",]
|===
| *Id*
| *Constraint*
| *Background and/or Motivation*

| *O1*
| *Schedule*
| TBD

| *O2*
| *Parts*
| The milestones described in *O1* already address the individual modules of the {projectName} project.

| *O3*
| *Process model*
| Development, agile/Scrum. To describe the architecture arc42 is used. +
An architecture documentation structured according to this template is a key project result.

| *O4*
| *Development tools*
| Design with http://draw.io/[Draw.io], in addition Magic Draw or Enterprise Architect. +
Solidity and JavaScript source code created in IntelliJ and Visual Studio Code.

| *O5*
| *Configuration management*
| Git at GitLab hosted by link:https://gitlab.cc-asp.fraunhofer.de/oe260/forest-guard/core[Fraunhofer IML]

| *O6*
| *Test tools and test processes*
| Unit testing as part of a CI/CD Pipeline (stage test) +

JavaScript based components: TBD +
Solidity based components: TBD.

| *O7*
| *Other tools*
| Node.js 20.x.y as JavaScript runtime +
npm 10.x.y for dependency management +
Solidity 0.8.x for smart contract development +
Hardhat 2.22.x as Ethereum development framework +
Kubernetes (OKD version 4.15)

| *P2*
| All dependencies are Open Source
| A complete list of (transitive) dependencies and their Open Source licenses needs to be provided.
