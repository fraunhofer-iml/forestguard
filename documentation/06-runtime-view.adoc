*Contents*

- 1 General Component Communication
- 2 Transaction related schemes and definitions
- 3 Use Cases and process flows

== General Component Communication

TBD

== Transaction related schemes and definitions

This Chapter outlines all available APIs in the following Order:

1. The Blockchain Connector which accepts AMQP messages related to the process.
2. The Api exposed through the BFF which the ForestGuard Frontend uses to query for data.

=== AMQP specific messaging interfaces and API

The Entity Management SVC and Process SVC serves as a Bridge and allows the following AMQP Endpoints.
